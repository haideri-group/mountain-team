## Project

TeamFlow — a JIRA-integrated team management dashboard for Tile Mountain. Tracks frontend developers across multiple JIRA boards (Production + project boards named after animals/birds). Built for frontend team leads to see what each dev is doing now, what's next, and whether workload is balanced.

See `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for the full 11-phase implementation roadmap, database schema, API routes, and all 14 screen specifications.

## Commands

```bash
yarn dev              # Start dev server (Next.js 16.2.2 + Turbopack)
yarn build            # Production build
yarn type-check       # TypeScript strict mode check (run before committing)
yarn lint             # ESLint 9 with Next.js + TypeScript rules
yarn lint:fix         # Auto-fix lint issues
yarn format           # Prettier format src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css,json}
yarn format:check     # Check formatting without writing
yarn db:push          # Push Drizzle schema to MySQL
yarn db:studio        # Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
yarn db:seed          # Seed database with hashed passwords (tsx scripts/seed.ts)
```

## Next.js 16 Conventions (IMPORTANT)

This project uses **Next.js 16.2.2** which has breaking changes from earlier versions. Always read bundled docs at `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before using unfamiliar APIs.

### Proxy (replaces Middleware)
- **`middleware.ts` is DEPRECATED.** The file convention is now `proxy.ts` with a named `proxy` export (or default export).
- Location: `src/proxy.ts` (same level as `app/`).
- Runtime: Node.js only (Edge runtime not supported for proxy).
- Config flags renamed: `skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize` → `skipProxyUrlNormalize`.
- Proxy is for optimistic checks (redirects, header manipulation), NOT full session management. Always verify auth inside Server Functions and API routes too.

### Async Request APIs
All request-time APIs are **async** and must be awaited:
- `cookies()` → `await cookies()`
- `headers()` → `await headers()`
- `draftMode()` → `await draftMode()`
- `params` in layouts/pages/routes → `await params`
- `searchParams` in pages → `await searchParams`

### Fetch & Caching
- `fetch()` is **NOT cached by default** (changed from Next.js 14).
- `GET` route handlers are **NOT cached by default**.
- Use `cache: 'force-cache'` or `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` to opt in.
- `cacheComponents: true` enables the new `'use cache'` directive (replaces `experimental.dynamicIO`).

### Removed / Deprecated in 16
- AMP support removed entirely.
- `next lint` command removed (use ESLint directly).
- `serverRuntimeConfig` / `publicRuntimeConfig` removed (use env vars).
- `next/legacy/image` removed (use `next/image`).
- `images.domains` deprecated (use `images.remotePatterns`).

### Other Key Patterns
- Server Components are the default. Only add `'use client'` when needed (hooks, event handlers, browser APIs).
- Server Functions (`'use server'`): always verify auth/authorization inside each function.
- Parallel routes require explicit `default.js` files in every `@slot` folder.
- Use `revalidatePath()`, `revalidateTag()`, or `redirect()` after mutations in Server Functions.

## Architecture

**Framework:** Next.js 16.2.2 with App Router, React Server Components, React 19.2.4
**Deployment:** Railway.app (hobby plan — daily crons only)

**Route structure:**
- `(auth)/login` — Public login page (no sidebar)
- `(dashboard)/overview` — Team overview with developer cards + team switcher
- `(dashboard)/calendar` — Monthly task calendar (placeholder)
- `(dashboard)/workload` — Capacity distribution (placeholder)
- `(dashboard)/members` — Team roster with server-side pagination
- `(dashboard)/members/[id]` — Developer profile (active or departed)
- `(dashboard)/reports` — Analytics with 12 chart sections (placeholder)
- `(dashboard)/settings` — Admin-only: team sync, issue sync, board management

Route groups `(auth)` and `(dashboard)` use separate layouts. Dashboard layout includes sidebar (280px dark navy) + topbar (64px).

**Database:** MySQL (Railway) with Drizzle ORM. 7 tables: users, team_members, boards, issues, sync_logs, dashboard_config, notifications.

**Auth:** Auth.js v5 (NextAuth beta) with Google OAuth + Credentials providers. JWT session strategy. Two roles: `admin` (full access) and `user` (read-only, no Settings/Sync). Google OAuth stores access token in JWT for Google Directory API access.

**State management:** Client-side `useState` + `fetch()` for data. No TanStack Query hooks yet — components fetch from API routes directly.

## Security

- **All API routes require authentication.** GET endpoints check `session?.user`, mutation endpoints (POST/PATCH/DELETE) check `session?.user?.role === "admin"`.
- **Error sanitization:** `sanitizeErrorText()` in `src/lib/jira/client.ts` redacts tokens from error messages before logging/throwing.
- **No hardcoded credentials.** The seed script uses bcrypt-hashed passwords. No fallback logins in code.
- **Cron endpoints** use `SYNC_SECRET` / `CRON_SECRET` bearer token auth.
- **Webhook endpoint** uses optional `x-webhook-secret` header verification.
- **`.env` / `.env.local` never committed** — verified in git history. `.gitignore` excludes them.

## Design System — Summit Logic

**No borders rule.** Layout boundaries use background color shifts, not 1px strokes. Cards sit on `#fbf9f8` surface with `#ffffff` card fill — contrast provides separation.

**Key colors:**
- Surface: `#fbf9f8` (base), `#f5f3f3` (sections/inputs), `#ffffff` (cards)
- Navy: `#1a1a2e` (sidebar, Sign In button, high-contrast text)
- Primary: `#ff8400` (brand orange), `#944a00` (dark variant for gradients)
- Use `outline-variant` at 15% opacity if a stroke is absolutely needed

**Typography:** JetBrains Mono for headings, KPI numbers, labels (UPPERCASE with letter-spacing). Inter for body text, descriptions, form inputs.

**Buttons:** Primary CTA uses gradient `#944a00 → #ff8400` at 135°. Sign In button uses flat navy `#1a1a2e` with UPPERCASE tracking-widest text. Secondary buttons use `surface-high` fill, no border.

**Popovers/dropdowns:** Use `bg-popover` with `ring-1 ring-foreground/10` and `shadow-lg`. Avoid native `<select>` dropdowns in dark mode — use custom styled dropdowns instead.

## Component Patterns

UI primitives in `src/components/ui/` use `@base-ui/react` headless components + `class-variance-authority` (cva) for variants + `cn()` utility from `src/lib/utils.ts` for class merging.

When building new components:
- Use existing shadcn/ui primitives as building blocks
- Follow the cva pattern for variant props
- Use design tokens from globals.css, not hardcoded colors
- Keep components as Server Components unless they need interactivity (onClick, useState, etc.)
- Use custom styled dropdowns instead of native `<select>` for dark mode compatibility

## Critical Business Rules

- **Done vs Closed:** `done` = completed full dev lifecycle (dev → QA → deploy). `closed` = task cancelled. Velocity and performance metrics count ONLY `done` tasks. Track `closed` separately as "cancelled".
- **Task keys identify boards:** `PROD-5555` = Production, `BUTTERFLY-112` = Butterfly project. No separate project tags needed in UI.
- **Production board has no sprints.** It's continuous. Never apply sprint labels or On Track/At Risk badges to PROD tasks.
- **Role badge only in profile dropdown.** Never show Admin/User badge in sidebar.
- **Task aging alerts:** Notify when a task stays in `in_progress` for 3+ days (configurable).
- **NEVER delete team members or their data.** When a member leaves, update status to `departed` — never remove the record. All historical task data, performance history, and assignments must be preserved for reporting and audit.
- **NEVER delete issues.** If a JIRA issue is deleted, the webhook marks it as `closed` (not removed from DB).
- **Clickable JIRA keys.** All issue keys (e.g., PROD-1143) must link to `{NEXT_PUBLIC_JIRA_BASE_URL}/browse/{key}` and open in a new tab. Use `e.stopPropagation()` on dev cards to prevent parent click.

## Team Member Sync (Atlassian Teams API)

Team members are **not manually managed** — they are auto-synced from the Atlassian Teams API. Multi-team support enabled.

**How it works:**
- `JIRA_ORG_ID` and `JIRA_TEAM_IDS` (comma-separated) define which teams to sync
- Sync fetches member accountIds from Teams API, then resolves user details from JIRA REST API
- Each member is tagged with their `teamId` and `teamName` from the Atlassian team
- **In team = `active`**, **removed from team = `departed`**, **rejoining = re-activated**
- New members are auto-created with auto-assigned colors from palette
- `displayName`, `email`, `avatarUrl` are updated from JIRA/Google on each sync
- Admin-managed fields (`capacity`, `role`, `color`) are never overwritten by sync
- `on_leave` status is admin-managed, not affected by sync (unless member leaves the org)
- Admin (Syed Haider Hassan) is excluded from sync via `/rest/api/3/myself`
- Safety check: aborts if API returns 0 members but DB has active members

**Google Directory integration:**
- When admin is signed in with Google OAuth, sync also matches emails + avatars from Google Workspace
- Uses Google People API `searchDirectoryPeople` with `directory.readonly` scope
- Multi-strategy name matching (full name → first+last → first only) with scoring
- Inline email edit on Members page has autocomplete dropdown from Google Directory (300ms debounce, min 3 chars)

**Sync triggers:**
- Daily cron at 06:00 UTC (`/api/cron/sync-teams`)
- Manual "Sync Now" button in Settings (admin only)

## JIRA Issue Sync

Issues are synced from JIRA into the `issues` table using JQL queries.

**How it works:**
- Uses `POST /rest/api/3/search/jql` (the old `/search` endpoint is deprecated)
- Token-based pagination with `nextPageToken` (not `startAt`), deduplication by key, max 50 pages safety
- Custom field IDs (story points, start date) discovered dynamically via `GET /rest/api/3/field`, cached 24h
- Status mapping: 21 JIRA status names → 7 app statuses, with `statusCategory.key` fallback
- Upsert via MySQL `onDuplicateKeyUpdate` on `jiraKey` unique index
- Cycle time calculated on status transitions to `done`, cleared on reopening
- Issues from untracked boards are skipped (admin must add board in Settings first)
- Unassigned issues synced with `assigneeId = null`
- Stores `jiraCreatedAt` and `jiraUpdatedAt` from JIRA for accurate sorting
- Live progress tracking polled by UI every 1 second during sync

**JQL filtering:** Issues are synced if they match EITHER condition:
- Assigned to any active team member (by JIRA accountId), OR
- Have the "Frontend" label (configurable via `JIRA_FRONTEND_LABEL` env var)
This ensures all team member work is captured regardless of labels, plus any Frontend-labelled issues from other assignees.

**Sync types:**
- **Full:** All matching issues from tracked boards
- **Incremental:** Matching issues updated since last successful sync
- **Manual:** Triggered by admin via Settings UI (full sync or per-board)

**Sync triggers:**
- Daily cron at 06:05 UTC (`/api/cron/sync-issues`) — auto-detects full vs incremental
- Manual "Sync Issues" button in Settings (admin only)
- Per-board sync button on each tracked board card

**JIRA Webhook** (`/api/webhooks/jira`):
- Receives real-time issue created/updated/deleted events
- Accepts issues assigned to tracked team members OR with Frontend label
- Normalizes and upserts single issue per event
- Setup guide: `docs/JIRA_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`

## GitHub Deployment Tracking (Phase 10.6 — planned)

Track which JIRA tasks are deployed to staging and production environments across multiple sites.

**Primary repo:** `tilemountainuk/tile-mountain-sdk` (frontend monorepo powering all live sites)

**Branch → environment mapping:**
- Live: `main-tilemtn`, `main-bathmtn`, `main-wallsandfloors`, `main-tilemtnae`, `main-waftrd`, `main-splendourtiles`
- Staging: `stage-tilemtn`, `stage-bathmtn`, `stage-wallsandfloors`, `stage-tilemtnae`, `stage-waftrd`, `stage-splendourtiles`
- Shared staging: `stage` (deploys to all staging unless excluded)
- Canonical: `main` (final sync ~24h after live with no issues)

**Data sources:**
- JIRA dev-status API (already connected, returns PR merge targets per issue)
- GitHub webhooks (real-time — fires when PR merged to deployment branch)

**JIRA key detection:** Regex `/[A-Z]{2,}-\d+/gi` on branch names, PR titles, commit messages. Developers use varied formats: `fix/PROD-5123`, `PROD-5123_v1`, `prod-5123`, etc.

**Pipeline visualization:** Feature Branch → Staging → Production → Main

## Public vs Protected Pages

**Public (read-only, no login required):**
- `/overview` — team overview with developer cards
- `/issue/[key]` — full issue detail with description, comments, GitHub data
- APIs: `GET /api/overview`, `GET /api/issues/*`, `GET /api/calendar`

**Protected (login required):**
- All other pages (Calendar, Members, Reports, Settings)
- All mutation endpoints (POST/PATCH/DELETE)
- Sync, notifications, search APIs

Guest users see no sidebar, no search/notifications/profile — just a "Sign In" button.

## Issue Detail Page (`/issue/[key]`)

Two-phase + GitHub loading:
1. **Phase 1 (instant):** DB data — issue fields, board/assignee context, cycle time percentile
2. **Phase 2 (background):** JIRA live — description (HTML), subtasks, attachments, linked issues, time tracking, worklogs
3. **Phase 3 (background):** GitHub — branches, PRs (via JIRA dev-status API), commits

**Comments:** Server-side paginated via `/api/issues/{key}/comments` (10 per page, sort asc/desc). Threaded display — replies detected by `@mention` at comment start, indented under parent. Comment deep links to JIRA via `focusedCommentId`.

**Issue Type Icons:** Exact JIRA SVGs (Bug=red insect, Story=green bookmark, Task=blue checkbox, Sub-task=blue puzzle, Epic=purple lightning). Shown next to issue keys across all pages.

**Time Tracking:** Progress bar when original estimate exists, text-only "Logged" when not. Per-person worklog breakdown from JIRA `/worklog` API.

**Date/Time:** Pakistan timezone (Asia/Karachi), 12h AM/PM. "Today at 4:38 PM" / "Yesterday at 11:00 AM" / "25 Mar 2026 at 4:38 PM".
